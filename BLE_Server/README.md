# CE230302 - AnyCloud: BLE CTS Server

This code example demonstrates the implementation of a simple BLE GAP Central - GATT Server with Current Time Service ([CTS](https://www.bluetooth.com/xml-viewer/?src=https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/Sitecore-Media-Library/Gatt/Xml/Services/org.bluetooth.service.current_time.xml)) using the Cypress Combo (Wi-Fi+BT) SoCs and ModusToolbox™ Software Environment.

In this code example, the kit scans for "BLE CTS Client", and after connection with a CTS-based client, sends notifications with Current Time Characteristic values derived from the local date and time. The time and date sent as notification are printed on the serial terminal.

Use this code example with [AnyCloud BLE CTS Client](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mtb-example-anycloud-ble-cts-client).

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the **Library Manager** to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application.

   To access the Library Manager, right-click the application name from the Project Workspace window in the IDE, and select **ModusToolbox** > **Library Manager** (or select it from the **Quick Panel**).

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example.

4. Optionally, update the **Application Name** and **Location** fields with the application name and local path where the application is created.

5. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

   For more details, see the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, navigate to the modus-shell directory (*{ModusToolbox install directory}/tools_\<version>/modus-shell*) and run *Cygwin.bat*.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

### In Third-party IDEs:

1. Follow the instructions from the [CLI](#in-command-line-interface-cli) section to download or clone the repository, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.


## Operation
1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Use your favorite serial terminal application and connect to the KitProg3 COM port. Configure the terminal application to access the serial port using the following settings.

   Baud rate: 115200 bps; Data: 8 bits; Parity: None; Stop: 1 bit; Flow control: None; New line for receive data: Line Feed(LF) or Auto setting

3. Program the board.

   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox**:

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**.


   - **Using CLI**:

      From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:

      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:

      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
      
        **Note**:  Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

   After programming, the application starts automatically. Observe the messages on the UART terminal, and wait for the device to make all the required connections.

   **Figure 1. Terminal Bootup Output**
   ![Figure 1](images/terminal_bootup_log.png)

4. Use another supported PSoC 6 kit and program it with the[AnyCloud BLE CTS Client](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mtb-example-anycloud-ble-cts-client) code example.

5. Once both the kits are powered, the kits will be auto connected. The server device will start sending the notification with Current Time Characteristic values derived from the device real-time clock. The date and time sent as notification will be printed on the serial terminal.

   **Figure 2. Terminal Output - Sending Notification**
   ![Figure 2](images/terminal_output.png)

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

## Design and Implementation
The [AnyCloud BLE CTS Server](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mtb-example-anycloud-ble-cts-server) code example configures the device as a BLE GAP Central - GATT Server device. Use this application with the [AnyCloud BLE CTS Client](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mtb-example-anycloud-ble-cts-client), which is a GAP Peripheral - GATT Client device.

This code example showcases the Current Time Service-based Time profile. In this, the mandatory Current Time Characteristic with Read and Notify properties are implemented. The Time profile defines two roles: Time Server (GATT Server) and Time Client (GATT Client).  

**Figure 4. Time Profile Role and Service Relationships**
![Figure 3](images/time_profile_roles.png)

The entry point of the application is `int main()`, which initializes the Board Support Package (BSP) and BT stack. The application level initializations, for example RTC, timer, GATT database initialization, are handled by the `ble_app_init()` function. This function starts scanning for the peripheral device by registering a callback using `wiced_bt_ble_scan()`. 

This application will specifically scan for advertisement with the Peripheral device name `BLE CTS Client` and establish a LE GATT connection. All the GATT events are handled in `ble_app_gatt_event_handler()`. During Read or Notify GATT operations, the fields of the Current Time characteristic are set to values derived from the local date and time and sent as GATT read response or as Notification to the Peripheral device. The same data is printed on the serial terminal.

The RTC provides time and date information – second, minute, hour, day of the week, date, month, and year using the RTC driver API. The time and date information are updated every second with automatic leap year compensation performed by the RTC hardware block. The RTC initialization is also done in `ble_app_init()`.

The application uses a UART resource from the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to print debug messages on a UART terminal emulator. The UART resource initialization and retargeting of the standard I/O to the UART port is done using the retarget-io library.

## Resources and Settings
This section explains the ModusToolbox resources and their configuration as used in this code example. Note that all the configuration explained in this section has already been done in the code example. ModusToolbox stores the configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the graphical configurators, which generate the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application’s *GeneratedSource* folder.

- **Device Configurator:** Use this tool to enable/configure the peripherals and pins used in the application. See the
[Device Configurator Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig).

- **Bluetooth Configurator:** Use this tool to generate/modify the BLE GATT database. See the
[Bluetooth Configurator Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig).
